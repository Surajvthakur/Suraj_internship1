  <h1>Exploring the Mysteries of the Deep: Journey into the Abyss</h1>
  
  <h2>DEEP FACTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Deep Ocean: The deep ocean refers to the part of the ocean below the surface layer called the "sunlight zone" or "euphotic zone." It extends from around 200 meters (656 feet) to the deepest points of the ocean.</li>
    <li>Enormous Depths: The deepest part of the ocean is the Mariana Trench located in the western Pacific Ocean. It reaches a depth of approximately 10,911 meters (35,797 feet) in the Challenger Deep.</li>
    <li>Pressure and Darkness: The deep ocean is characterized by immense pressure due to the weight of the water above. At the depths of the Mariana Trench, the pressure can exceed 1,000 times that of the surface, equivalent to about 50 jumbo jets stacked on top of each other. Additionally, the deep ocean is mostly devoid of natural light, making it incredibly dark.</li>
  </ul>
